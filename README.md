# College_timetable-Project
#Overview
This project aims to create a simple college timetable system using HTML and CSS. The system allows users to view and manage their class schedules.In this project I used <table> tag to form table and to style it I used inline CSS in which I am done coloring of the coloumns background and the font of the text,etc.
For now this is just a static timetable but in upcoming days i design it to make changement in it at the dashboard.
